# Fall 2022 Personal Breast Cancer Project for SAAS
Code and data for my personal research project on the predictive power that TP53 has on breast cancer prognosis

I chose the topic because I am very interested in the topic of breast cancer due to personal reasons and I’m also interested in exploring the applications of data into the medical field especially since I’ve always had an interest in it. Furthermore, I think the topic is important because with increasing maturity of gene analysis and genetically targeted medications, by delving deeper into specific genes, it will provide more insight on treatments or approaches that can be taken with patients. Finally, I once wrote an abstract for a project proposal from an experimental point of view (i.e. using cancer cell samples and testing chemotherapy on them) on how different anthracycline chemotherapies had effects on cancers with the TP53 mutation, so I suppose this is a way of continuing my interest.

The Subtyped Data file is the data after I assigned the corresponding subtypes to each data source using code seen in Oct_25 code
